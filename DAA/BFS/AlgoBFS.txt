BFS(arr, visited, i, n):
    Initialize an empty queue
    Mark visited[i] as 1 (visited) and print i
    Add i to the queue
    While queue is not empty:
        Dequeue vertex from front of queue
        For each vertex j from 0 to n-1:
            If there is an edge between vertex and j (arr[vertex][j] == 1):
                If j is not visited (visited[j] == 0):
                   Mark visited[j] as 1 (visited) and print j
                   Add j to the queue
