Kruskals(Graph, Vertices)
    Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight
    Initialize edges and cost to 0
    While edges < Vertices - 1
        Pick the smallest edge not yet picked
        Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far
        If the cycle is not formed
            Include this edge in the minimum spanning tree
            Increment the cost by its edge weight

Design Strategy: Greedy

T = O(E logE) or O(E logV)

S = O(V + E)
