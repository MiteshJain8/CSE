BFS(Graph[], visited[], start)
    Mark the starting vertex as visited
    Append the starting vertex to the queue.
    While the queue is not empty
        Pop a vertex from the queue (and print)
        For each neighbor of the current vertex
            If the neighbor has not been visited
                Mark it as visited
                Append it to the queue

Design Strategy: Level-order traversal

T = O(V+E)

S = O(V+E) due to adjacency list
