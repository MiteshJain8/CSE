Dijkstra’s Algorithm (G, s)
  Let S be the set of explored nodes
  For each u ∈ S, we store a distance d(u)
  Initially, S = {s} and d(s) = 0

  While S ≠ V do
    Select a node v ∉ S with at least one edge from S for which
    d'(v) = min_{e=(u,v) : u ∈ S} {d(u) + weight(e)} is as small as possible
    Add v to S
    Define d(v) = d'(v)
