Initialize sets col, posDiag, and negDiag to track columns and diagonals under attack
Create an empty 'board' of size n×n and an empty list 'res' to store results

Backtrack(r, n)
    If all queens are placed (r == n), append the current board configuration to 'res'
    For each column c in the current row r, 
        Check if placing a queen there is safe, a position is safe if c is not in col, r+c is not in posDiag, and r-c is not in negDiag
        If safe, place the queen (update sets)
        Recursively call backtrack for the next row (r+1)
        After the recursive call, remove the queen (update sets)

Design Strategy: Backtracking

T = O(n!) since its a brute force approach

S = O(n×n) due to board
