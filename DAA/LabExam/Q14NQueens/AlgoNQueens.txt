Initialize sets col, posDiag, and negDiag to track columns and diagonals under attack
Create an empty 'board' and an empty list 'res' to store results

Function backtrack(r, n)
    If all queens are placed (r == n), append the current board configuration to 'res'
    For each column c in the current row r, 
        Check if placing a queen there is safe, a position is safe if c is not in col, r+c is not in posDiag, and r-c is not in negDiag
        If safe, place the queen (update sets)
        Recursively call backtrack for the next row (r+1)
        After the recursive call, remove the queen (update sets)

T = O(n!)
S = O(n)
